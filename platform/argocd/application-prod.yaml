  # Sync policy
  # PRODUCTION NOTE: Auto-sync is enabled but changes require explicit promotion.
  # The CMP plugin only fetches LiveRevisionNum from ConfigHub.
  # This means:
  # - CI can push new revisions (HeadRevisionNum advances)
  # - ArgoCD won't sync until 'cub unit apply' promotes them (LiveRevisionNum advances)
  # - HIGH risk changes require multi-party approval before promotion
  # - Delete gates protect stateful resources (DynamoDB, S3)
  # See docs/tiered-authority-model.md for production governance details.
  syncPolicy:
    # Automated sync: continuously reconcile ConfigHub Live revisions -> Kubernetes
    automated:
      # Remove resources from cluster when deleted from ConfigHub
      # NOTE: For prod, delete gates in ConfigHub prevent accidental deletion
      prune: true
      # Auto-heal: revert manual changes to match ConfigHub
      selfHeal: true
      # Allow empty: don't fail if ConfigHub returns no resources
      allowEmpty: false
