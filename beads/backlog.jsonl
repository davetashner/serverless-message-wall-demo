Include examples for common scenarios (database passwords, API keys).","acceptance":["Documentation explains secrets reference syntax in Claims","Example provided for database password injection","Example provided for external API key usage","Troubleshooting section for common secrets errors","Documentation lives alongside Claim schema docs"],"status":"pending"}

{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-26","title":"Change velocity controls and rollback orchestration","intent":"Implement controls that limit blast radius of configuration changes and enable coordinated rollback when changes cause harm. Support canary deployments, change freezes, and automatic rollback on health degradation.","principles":["Limit blast radius by default","Rollback is always possible","Health signals trigger automatic response","Change freezes are enforceable"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-27","title":"Service catalog and discoverability","intent":"Provide a catalog of available platform products (XRDs, Claims) so teams can discover what's available, understand schemas, and provision resources through self-service. Include versioning, deprecation notices, and migration guides.","principles":["Discoverable beats documented","Schema is the source of truth","Deprecation is communicated early","Examples for every product"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-28","title":"Self-service tenant onboarding","intent":"Automate the provisioning of new teams and divisions onto the platform. A single onboarding action should create ConfigHub spaces, Kubernetes namespaces, IAM boundaries, initial quotas, and baseline policies.","principles":["Onboarding is one action, not twenty","Secure by default","Quotas from day one","Offboarding cleans up completely"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-29","title":"Enterprise identity and access integration","intent":"Integrate with enterprise identity providers for authentication and authorization. Define role hierarchies, approval workflow integration with identity, and compliance reporting for auditors.","principles":["SSO everywhere","Roles map to real organizational structure","Approvals are traceable to identities","Audit artifacts are exportable"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-30","title":"Drift detection and continuous reconciliation","intent":"Formalize how drift between desired state (ConfigHub) and actual state (AWS) is detected, reported, and remediated. Define policies for when to auto-remediate vs alert vs accept drift.","principles":["Drift is detected, not ignored","Not all drift requires remediation","Out-of-band changes are captured","Trending reveals systemic issues"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-31","title":"Schema lifecycle and migration","intent":"Define how platform schemas (XRDs) evolve over time. Establish versioning strategy, backward compatibility guarantees, migration automation, and deprecation timelines.","principles":["Schema changes are planned, not reactive","Migrations are automated where possible","Deprecation has a timeline","Breaking changes require migration path"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-32","title":"Control plane performance and scalability","intent":"Ensure the platform scales to thousands of Claims across hundreds of teams. Benchmark ConfigHub, Crossplane, and ArgoCD under load. Define scaling strategies and performance acceptance criteria.","principles":["Measure before optimizing","Scaling is horizontal where possible","Performance budgets are explicit","Degradation is graceful"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-33","title":"Testing and preview environments","intent":"Enable infrastructure change testing through preview environments, PR-based previews, and integration test harnesses. Support chaos engineering for platform resilience validation.","principles":["Test infrastructure like code","Preview before merge","Chaos reveals weaknesses","Staging mirrors production topology"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-34","title":"Network and connectivity patterns","intent":"Define patterns for VPC provisioning, cross-account networking, private endpoints, and service mesh integration. Establish templates that teams can use without deep networking expertise.","principles":["Networking is a platform concern","Templates over custom configs","Security groups are restrictive by default","Connectivity is documented"]}
{"type":"epic","id":"EPIC-35","title":"Agent operational boundaries","intent":"Define identity, rate limits, quotas, and monitoring for AI agents operating on the platform. Establish procedures for agent credential rotation, anomaly detection, and emergency suspension.","principles":["Agents have explicit identity","Rate limits prevent runaway automation","Anomalies trigger alerts, not just logs","Suspension is immediate when needed"]}
